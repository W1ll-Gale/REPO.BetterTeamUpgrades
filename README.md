# BetterTeamUpgrades
A **host only** and **better** alternative to shared upgrade mods such as _SharedUpgrades_ or _TeamUpgrades_. This mod implements a robus and maintainable shared upgrade system that supports both vanilla upgrades and modded upgrades, as well as late join upgrade syncing.  

Thank you for **100,000+** downloads!!

## Features

### Host Only

- **ONLY** the game host needs to have this mod installed!

Say bye to having to checking if your friends have the right mods or getting your friends to use install mods XD. 

### Shared Upgrades

- ALL upgrades used are shared between all players in the game. This includes both all vanilla upgrades and all modded upgrades!

- The mod is written in a way that it will never be out of date when new vanilla upgrades are added (hopfully).

- This feature can be turned off in config and supports [REPOConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/) for live ingame config editing without needing to restart.

  _(this means you can have late join player upgrade syncing on without needing shared upgrades on and vice versa)_

_Note: I have only tested the upgrade sharing for modded upgrades with the MoreUpgrades mod and all players are still required to have the modded upgrades mod(s), so keep that in mind and use those with your own risk. If your modded upgrades cause problems with this mod there is a setting in this mods config to turn off custom upgrade syncing._

### Late join player upgrade syncing

- ALL uogrades are synced with any late joining player. This includes both all vanilla upgrades and all modded upgrades!
    No more friends complaining they are so far behind in upgrades XD.
